*** README for "pm-utils light"

Like pm-utils as much as possible.

Pros:
 * It tries its best to run hooks in exactly the same way as pm-utils.
 * It's faster
 * It can load hooks from a .so file, which is much faster, avoids
   context switches and allows to keep state conveniently in memory.
 * .so files will be loaded also if they are not executable. Install a
   non-executable .so file to have it loaded by pm-utils light but ignored by
   pm-utils.
 * It allows to cancel a resume, for example in order to go back to sleep in
   case of a resume for usb disconnect.

Cons:
 * No support for quirks
 * It does not ship the functions and pm-functions shell libraries, so plugins
   cannot make use of them

Tips:

 * To disable the existing pm-utils hooks:
   cd /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d
   for i in *; do touch /etc/pm/sleep.d/$i; done


*** README for omhacks

It is a fast and simple library of common openmoko utility functions.

There is a very simple command line front-end called "om", which exposes all
the library functions. Just run om to get its command line help.

The extra om-led executable is the same as running "om led", but is also
provided separately so that it's possible to make "om-led" suid but not "om".


*** TODO list
 - recreate lindi's suspend/resume scripts
 - suspend/resume GPS
 - package
    - update-alternatives for pm-suspend
    - tips for dpkg-statoverride on om-led
 - hook that calls atq and sets rtcwake to wake for the next at event
 - zavai calls pm-suspend
 - upload to pkg-fso
 - zavai hooks (alarm, mostly)
 - fork pm-utils-light off omhacks at a later stage

16:18 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: a few questions:
16:18 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: 1. why do you lock the touch screen? my phone doesn't wake up if the 
                                 touchscreen is not locked
16:18 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: 2. what's the fiddling with sysrq-trigger?
16:19 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: 3. why touch /tmp/frameworkd.pid ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16:40 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: 1. to make sure that i don't accidentally type "rm -fr /" when the phone 
                                 is in my pocket and wakes up with rtc
16:40 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: 2. sysrq trigger just makes sure kernel does not log anything on resume 
                                 to display, this used to slow things down a lot with debugging information
16:40 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: 3. gsm-watchdog looks at the freshness of /tmp/frameworkd.pid
16:41 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: 3. (Right after resume ogsmd won't respond to dbus. touching pid file 
                                 makes sure the watchdog does not immediately kill ogsmd in this case but waits 
                                 for a while)
