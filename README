To disable the existing hooks:

 - cd /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d
   for i in *; do touch /etc/pm/sleep.d/$i; done

Currently not automatically done:

 - mkdir -p /var/run/pm-utils/pm-suspend/storage

TODO:
 - recreate lindi's suspend/resume scripts
    - resume reason
    - fix resume cancelation
 - suspend/resume GPS
 - mkdir -p /var/run/pm-utils/pm-suspend/storage
 - package
 - zavai calls pm-suspend
 - upload to pkg-fso
 - zavai hooks (alarm, mostly)
 - fork pm-utils-light of omhacks at a later stage

16:18 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: a few questions:
16:18 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: 1. why do you lock the touch screen? my phone doesn't wake up if the 
                                 touchscreen is not locked
16:18 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: 2. what's the fiddling with sysrq-trigger?
16:19 #openmoko-debian < enrico> lindi-: 3. why touch /tmp/frameworkd.pid ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16:40 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: 1. to make sure that i don't accidentally type "rm -fr /" when the phone 
                                 is in my pocket and wakes up with rtc
16:40 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: 2. sysrq trigger just makes sure kernel does not log anything on resume 
                                 to display, this used to slow things down a lot with debugging information
16:40 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: 3. gsm-watchdog looks at the freshness of /tmp/frameworkd.pid
16:41 #openmoko-debian < lindi-> enrico: 3. (Right after resume ogsmd won't respond to dbus. touching pid file 
                                 makes sure the watchdog does not immediately kill ogsmd in this case but waits 
                                 for a while)
