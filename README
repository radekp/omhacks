To disable the existing hooks:

 - cd /usr/lib/pm-utils/sleep.d
   for i in *; do touch /etc/pm/sleep.d/$i; done

Currently not automatically done:

 - mkdir -p /var/run/pm-utils/pm-suspend/storage

TODO:
 - recreate lindi's suspend/resume scripts
 - mkdir -p /var/run/pm-utils/pm-suspend/storage
 - package
 - zavai calls pm-suspend
 - upload to pkg-fso
 - zavai hooks (alarm, mostly)
 - fork pm-utils-light of omhacks at a later stage
